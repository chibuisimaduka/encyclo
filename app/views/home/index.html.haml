  %h1 Welcome to Lancyclo Beta!

  %p Lancyclo is meant to be a free structured database about <u>everything</u>.
  
  %p It is currently composed mainly of movies, actors and documents from wikipedia. The best way to see the result is to search for "movie" and start exploring from there! You can also sign in to be able to rate movies and get suggestions.

  %p There is a lot of cool features that are disabled until they are production ready. You can read more about the project by checking the project <a href="https://github.com/pascalr/encyclo#readme">github page</a>.

  %p Have fun visiting and please come back soon to see some cool new features.
  
  -#%p You can easily change language with the dropdown select at the top. The name of entities will be in the selected language or in another language if not present. The documents will be filtered by the selected language.
  
  -#%p One of the main ideas is that it is <u>yours</u>. You do everything you want and we take can of sharing it and using it to serve you better. In the same way, you get what others do which is filtered based on your preferences and people opinions.
  
  -#%p There is no such thing as an admin on The Encyclo. We judge users based on others. If you write nonsense, your credibility will fall quickly. Hence, if you write a lot of good stuff, your credibility will be really high.
  
  -#%p We believe in freedom and the power of free knowledge. The source code is available (feel free to contribute) and you can download the whole database (as soon as I set it up..). Also, it is advertisement-free.
