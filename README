The Encyclo is a structured database about <u>everything</u>. It can integrate any type of media: videos, songs, wikis, q&as, essays, images... It is design to facilitate searching and entering data easily with no duplication.

The best way to put it is a better generic Wikipedia. Wikipedia limits itself to encyclopedic content (you cannot write content as a resume, an essay..) and limits itself to text documents.

The goal is to make the content database and the only content database that everyone uses. In order to do this, we can't just relie on brand like most companies do, you have the make the perfect website. It has to be free. It is. It has to be upgradable. It is open source. It has to be efficient. That's our main priority. It has to be customizable. You can push new document media and templates in code and you can choose the styling that you want for the database.

The database is design to be efficient. For example, it is tri-dimentional: If you enter an actor for a movie, the movie will have the actor, the actor will have the movie and the actor will be an actor.

Think of all the websites that could be integrated into a single database : IMDB, github, ebay, amazon, craiglists, wikipedia, ehow, yahoo answers, stackoverflow, and so on.. At least 80% of the most visited websites could be replaced by one. And this excludes search engines that would become pretty useless.

It is better than a search engine because it permits better granularity. For example, if you want to buy a laptop, a search engine will bring you on retailer's website. The Encyclo will show you each product and the price for each retailer for each product instead.

You can easily change language with the dropdown select at the top. The name of entities will be in the selected language or in another language if not present. The documents will be filtered by the selected language.

One of the main ideas is that it is <u>yours</u>. You do everything you want and we take can of sharing it and using it to serve you better. In the same way, you get what others do which is filtered based on your preferences and people opinions.
  
There is no such thing as an admin on The Encyclo. We judge users based on others. If you write nonsense, your credibility will fall quickly. Hence, if you write a lot of good stuff, your credibility will be really high.
  
We believe in freedom and the power of free knowledge. The source code is available (feel free to contribute) and you can download the whole database (as soon as I set it up..). Also, it is advertisement-free.

== TODOs (ordered by importance*time)

- Refactor document model structure. Document should be abstract model that maybe would include entity too.
- Add more rules to delete like association definition and components should be considered less easilly.
  Also, an entity that has less content should be deletable easily. One that has much should be less.
  If a user create an entity than delete it, it should be purged.
- Be able to change the language of a document.
- Add document medias (videos, sounds, wikis, websites, entities..)
- Cancel toggle_visibility by pressing the escape key.
- A watchlist. A list of entities that the user wants to watch or is watching.
- Add user favorites. (movie, song...)
- A better document show view.
- A multilingual layout.
- Create a static form field to enter commands that are most likely just javascript code. (ex: login, logout, [create entity])
- A order function for entities to order by associations/attributes/components/documents/... Pretty self explanatory.
- A select function for entities to see the associations/attributes/components/documents/... that you want. ( similar to SQL select )
- When adding coordinates to entities, add a nearby entities feature. You can see entities who are close.
- Make many games in this site to encourage users to do stuff. Collect coins..
- Remove duplication for select menus with javascript. Add the content instead of hidding it.
- A trash can maybe..

== FIXMEs

- Be able to set the language universal for an entity and it's sub-descendants.
- When deleting entities, you should not be able to see it in the search.
- The entity validations should all be based on the current user. Based on what he has deleted.
- Not definitive changing parents of entity.
- Make the names accent sensitives. You curently can't just add an accent to a name.
- The editing of association definitions many/one.
- If you look at Entity, you should see the best ranked entities overall. How do you do that? Same for other big categories..

== Content TODOs

- List of colors: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors
- Put my code on the site. (hover and toggle at least)
- Add sciences like mathematic documents and create it's hierarchy.
- Add a prononciation component to entities.
- My bookmarks

== Content FIXMEs

- Is flag an association or a component of a location.
- A book is an entity and also a document for other entities. What to do with this? Document type = entity ?
- What the hell is the name of a quote? Is it even an entity. Should be for everything except for the name.
  Because a quote should have documents, not images though.. Associations?

== Feature ideas

- You can play songs you have and it will play them based on your ranking.
The more you like it, it will be more played.

- There is a "nostalgie" view where you are shown old things you used to like.

- The search bar is hacker frendly. You can do more than simple search like in google.
Ex: string < ruby :doc
string for entity named string
smaller than ruby for child of ruby
colon doc for seeing a documentation document
Ex2: movie $genre=action,comedy
movie for seing a movie
dollar genre equals action and comedy for mathcing predicate genre = action AND movie
# The dollar is there for better autocomplete purposes.
# You can also specify that you thrust Isaac.
