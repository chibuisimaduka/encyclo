== TODOs (ordered by importance*time)

- Image and document pagination.
- Be able to change the language of a document.
- Add more rules to delete like association definition and components should be considered less easilly.
  Also, an entity that has less content should be deletable easily. One that has much should be less.
  If a user create an entity than delete it, it should be purged.
- Cancel toggle_visibility by pressing the escape key.
- Add document medias (videos, sounds, wikis, websites, entities..)
- A watchlist. A list of entities that the user wants to watch or is watching.
- Add user favorites. (movie, song...)
- A better document show view.
- A multilingual layout.
- Create a static form field to enter commands that are most likely just javascript code. (ex: login, logout, [create entity])
- A order function for entities to order by associations/attributes/components/documents/... Pretty self explanatory.
- A select function for entities to see the associations/attributes/components/documents/... that you want. ( similar to SQL select )
- When adding coordinates to entities, add a nearby entities feature. You can see entities who are close.
- Make many games in this site to encourage users to do stuff. Collect coins..
- Remove duplication for select menus with javascript. Add the content instead of hidding it.

== FIXMEs

- Be able to set the language universal for an entity and it's sub-descendants.
- When deleting entities, you should not be able to see it in the search.
- The entity validations should all be based on the current user. Based on what he has deleted.
- Not definitive changing parents of entity.
- Make the names accent sensitives. You curently can't just add an accent to a name.
- The editing of association definitions many/one.
- If you look at Entity, you should see the best ranked entities overall. How do you do that? Same for other big categories..

== Content TODOs

- List of colors: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors
- Put my code on the site. (hover and toggle at least)
- Add sciences like mathematic documents and create it's hierarchy.
- Add a prononciation component to entities.

== Content FIXMEs

- Is flag an association or a component of a location.
- A book is an entity and also a document for other entities. What to do with this? Document type = entity ?
- What the hell is the name of a quote? Is it even an entity. Should be for everything except for the name.
  Because a quote should have documents, not images though.. Associations?

== Feature ideas

- You can play songs you have and it will play them based on your ranking.
The more you like it, it will be more played.

- There is a "nostalgie" view where you are shown old things you used to like.

- The search bar is hacker frendly. You can do more than simple search like in google.
Ex: string < ruby :doc
string for entity named string
smaller than ruby for child of ruby
colon doc for seeing a documentation document
Ex2: movie $genre=action,comedy
movie for seing a movie
dollar genre equals action and comedy for mathcing predicate genre = action AND movie
# The dollar is there for better autocomplete purposes.
# You can also specify that you thrust Isaac.
