== TODOs

- Data consistency rules at the database level. (avoid duplicates at least)
- Figure out the document types.
- Create a static form field to enter commands that are most likely just javascript code. (ex: login, logout, [create entity])
- A select function to see the associations/attributes/components/documents/... that you want. ( similar to SQL select )
- A order function to order by associations/attributes/components/documents/... Pretty self explanatory.
- When adding coordinates to entities, add a nearby entities feature. You can see entities who are close.
- Image and document pagination.
- Be able to change the language of a document.
- Add user favorites. (movie, song...)
- Make many games in this site to encourage users to do stuff. Collect coins..
- Cancel toggle_visibility by pressing the escape key.
- A watchlist. A list of entities that the user wants to watch or is watching.

== FIXMEs

- When deleting entities, you should not be able to see it in the search.
- The entity validations should all be based on the current user. Based on what he has deleted.
- Not definitive changing parents of entity.
- Make the names accent sensitives. You curently can't just add an accent to a name.
- The editing of association definitions many/one.

== Content TODOs

- List of colors: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors
- Put my code on the site. (hover and toggle at least)
- Add sciences like mathematics documents and create it's hierarchy.
- Add a prononciation component to entities.

== Content FIXMEs

- Is flag an association or a component of a location.
- A book is an entity and also a document for other entities. What to do with this? Document type = entity ?
- What the hell is the name of a quote? Is it even an entity. Should be for everything except for the name.
  Because a quote should have documents, not images though.. Associations?

== Feature ideas

- You can play songs you have and it will play them based on your ranking.
The more you like it, it will be more played.

- There is a "nostalgie" view where you are shown old things you used to like.

- The search bar is hacker frendly. You can do more than simple search like in google.
Ex: string < ruby :doc
string for entity named string
smaller than ruby for child of ruby
colon doc for seeing a documentation document
Ex2: movie $genre=action,comedy
movie for seing a movie
dollar genre equals action and comedy for mathcing predicate genre = action AND movie
# The dollar is there for better autocomplete purposes.
# You can also specify that you thrust Isaac.

== REMINDER
Console options:
* Passing the <tt>-s, --sandbox</tt> argument will rollback any modifications made to the database.
