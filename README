== TODOs

- Data consistency rules at the database level. (avoid duplicates at least)
- Figure out the document types.

== Feature ideas

- You can play songs you have and it will play them based on your ranking.
The more you like it, it will be more played.

- There is a "nostalgie" view where you are shown old things you used to like.

- The search bar is hacker frendly. You can do more than simple search like in google.
Ex: string < ruby :doc
string for entity named string
smaller than ruby for child of ruby
colon doc for seeing a documentation document
Ex2: movie $genre=action,comedy
movie for seing a movie
dollar genre equals action and comedy for mathcing predicate genre = action AND movie
# The dollar is there for better autocomplete purposes.
# You can also specify that you thrust Isaac.

== FIXME

A book is an entity and also a document for other entities.

== REMINDER
Console options:
* Passing the <tt>-s, --sandbox</tt> argument will rollback any modifications made to the database.
