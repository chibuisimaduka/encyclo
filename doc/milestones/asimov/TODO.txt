Asimov is an artificial intelligence. He is used to give a more entertaining experience to the user. He gives hints, facts or just jokes. You can also customize him a lot. Ideally, you could interact with him and make him do anything!

He would be kinda like the voice in Portal 2.

I just though that it sounds a lot like Clipee from Microsoft Word.. Damn. But don't worry, it will be nothing like that.

Why Asimov?
In honor of Isaac Asimov who wrote a lot about robotics. Also, it's initials are IA, Intelligence Artificielle.

Add a lot of comments he says randomly that are hints. "You can do that, you know?"
Add some ads combined with jokes. "Click on it. I know you want to."
